# Lesson 5. Long distance race

## Objective

Write a program with a specific sequence of movements.

## Introduction

Now that you know how to control the robot in four directions, this lesson requires you to craft a sequence of commands to guide the robot along a predefined route.

## Theory

Throughout the preceding lessons, you've been creating programs. Let's define what a program is: a program is an ordered sequence of commands. These commands are executed by a designated executor, which, in our case, is the robot.

Each function within the **lineRobot** library executes a sequence of commands specific to that function. In the upcoming lessons, you'll advance to writing your own functions using the basic functions of the Python programming language.

## Assignment

Write a program for the robot to follow the route represented in the image.

You can refresh your memory of the library functions by revisiting the previous lessons.

## Conclusion

You are awesome! You've gained insight into the concept of a program and its executor. In the next lesson, you'll learn how to control the robot's speed.

# Mission 1.1 Welcome to Artemis Support Program

## Objective

Join the Artemis Support Program, familiarize yourself with the Mission Control Interface, and establish a connection with the Lunar Terrain Vehicle (LTV).

## Introduction

Welcome, Recruit!

You have been selected for the **Artemis Support Program**. Your goal is to develop and test software for the next generation of lunar rovers. We are returning to the Moon, and this time, we are staying.

To assist the astronauts, we are deploying autonomous **Lunar Terrain Vehicles (LTV)**. Before we send them to the lunar South Pole, they must be tested in our simulation facility.

Watch the briefing video below to understand the mission:

## Mission Control Interface

Before you begin coding, take a moment to understand your workspace.

![Interface](https://github.com/autolab-fi/lineRobot-micropython-course/blob/main/images/module-1/Interface1.png?raw=true)

* **Red Box:** This area contains the **Mission Briefing** (instructions). Read these carefully.
* **Yellow Box:** This is the **Code Editor**. Here you will write your Python scripts.
* **White Box:** This is the **Terminal**. It shows the status of your upload and any messages from the rover.
* **Blue Box:** This shows the **Live Video Feed** of the rover executing your code.
    *Note: Sometimes the video may take time to load, just be patient*
* **Red Arrow:** The **Verify** button. You will use this to upload your code to the rover.

## Instructions

Let's run a system check to make sure you are connected to the facility. You don't need to write code yet — just upload the test protocol.

Upload the program to the rover - see the animation below: click the Verify button (Red Arrow), watch the video feed (Blue Box):

## Conclusion

System check complete!

You have successfully connected to the platform and verified the communication link. In the next mission, we will introduce you to the rover hardware and analyze how this code actually works.

Proceed to next Mission

# Browser simulation configuration

`manifest.json` contains course-owned simulation modes and checks. Physical
verification remains in `verifications/` and is executed only by the lab worker.

`generated/task-metadata.json` is derived from verifier `target_points`. Generate
it from the sibling `browser-robot-sim` repository with `npm run course:extract`.
The coordinate conversion flips the physical arena Y axis and converts centimetres
to metres; direction vectors become simulator headings.

Reference solutions are not stored here or sent to students. They may be used by
trusted compatibility tests, identified only by task id and source hash.
